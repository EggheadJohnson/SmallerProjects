# D3js

A small collection of my more successful D3 learning projects.

**Climbing a Hill** - Click up and down to both move a circle over a hill and watch the hill fill and drain.

**Commute Data** - I have a long commute.  A while ago I wanted to study just how long it is.  This is a dump of my commute data, and can be viewed by day.  Still a WIP.

**Mastering Exit** - I needed to understand how selection.exit().remove() worked in D3.  So I made this.
