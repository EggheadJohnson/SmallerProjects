# JavaScript
A small collection of JS projects that I did to learn various skills and/or interesting algorithms.

**myUnderscore.js** - When I was studying JavaScript, particularly callbacks, it was recommended to me that I replicate the work done by the underscore.js project.  As it happens, this was enormously helpful.  This is my complete collection of functions to this end.  The project was also enormously fun.

**sakamoto.js** - I am particularly interested in calendars and knowing what day of the week it is (personal idiosyncrasy).  I had previously learned the doomsday method (http://www.timeanddate.com/date/doomsday-weekday.html) as a parlor trick and convenience for knowing what day of the week something is but I later learned about the Sakamoto algorithm for determining what day of the week a given date was.

**D3js** - Had some downtime at work and we were thinking about implementing a feature in D3js.  Except that none of us knew it at the time, so I took it upon myself to learn.  This is a small collection of the more interesting of my studies.
